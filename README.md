# Weather Prediction

A modular pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models for weather prediction

## Overview

This project provides a structured approach to developing weather prediction models using machine learning techniques. It includes separate pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and inference, facilitating easy experimentation and deployment.

## Features

* **Modular Pipelines**: Separate directories for feature engineering, training, and inference.
* **Configurable Workflows**: Easily adjust parameters and settings via configuration files.
* **Scalable Design**: Structured to accommodate various datasets and model architectures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isakovsh/weather_prediction.git
   cd weather_prediction
   ```



2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```



3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



## Usage

### Feature Engineering

Navigate to the `feature_pipeline` directory and execute the preprocessing scripts to prepare your dataset.

```bash
cd feature_pipeline
python preprocess_data.py
```



### Model Training

Use the `training_pipeline` to train your machine learning model. Ensure that the preprocessed data is available.

```bash
cd ../training_pipeline
python train_model.py
```



### Inference

After training, use the `inference_pipeline` to make predictions on new data.([Google Colab][2])

```bash
cd ../inference_pipeline
python predict.py
```
